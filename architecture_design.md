# Spotify Song Recommendation System - Architecture Design

## Overview
This application is a web-based song recommendation system that uses the Spotify API to retrieve and play songs, and an AI-based recommendation engine that learns from user feedback over time. Users can provide feedback through "I like" and "I don't like" buttons, which helps the system improve its recommendations.

## Components

### 1. User Authentication System
- User registration and login functionality
- Session management
- User profile storage
- OAuth integration with Spotify (for accessing user's Spotify data)

### 2. Database Schema
- **Users Table**
  - user_id (primary key)
  - username
  - email
  - password_hash
  - spotify_access_token
  - spotify_refresh_token
  - created_at
  - last_login

- **Songs Table**
  - song_id (primary key)
  - spotify_id
  - title
  - artist
  - album
  - genre
  - features (JSON field for audio features)
  - popularity
  - preview_url

- **User Preferences Table**
  - preference_id (primary key)
  - user_id (foreign key)
  - song_id (foreign key)
  - rating (like/dislike)
  - timestamp

- **Recommendations Table**
  - recommendation_id (primary key)
  - user_id (foreign key)
  - song_id (foreign key)
  - recommendation_score
  - is_shown (boolean)
  - timestamp

### 3. Spotify API Integration
- Authentication with Spotify API
- Song search and retrieval
- Audio features extraction
- Playback functionality
- Playlist management

### 4. AI Recommendation Engine
- Initial recommendation based on user's listening history or preferences
- Feature-based recommendation using song attributes
- Collaborative filtering based on similar users' preferences
- Reinforcement learning from user feedback
- Periodic retraining of the model

### 5. Frontend Interface
- Responsive web design (works on desktop and mobile)
- User authentication pages
- Song recommendation display
- Music player with controls
- "I like" and "I don't like" buttons
- User profile and preference management
- History of liked/disliked songs

## API Endpoints

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/spotify` - Initiate Spotify OAuth flow
- `GET /api/auth/spotify/callback` - Handle Spotify OAuth callback

### User Endpoints
- `GET /api/user/profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/user/profile` - Update user profile
- `GET /api/user/preferences` - Get user preferences
- `GET /api/user/history` - Get user listening history

### Recommendation Endpoints
- `GET /api/recommendations` - Get song recommendations
- `POST /api/feedback` - Submit feedback on a song (like/dislike)
- `GET /api/songs/{id}` - Get details of a specific song
- `GET /api/songs/search` - Search for songs

### Playback Endpoints
- `GET /api/playback/play/{id}` - Play a specific song
- `GET /api/playback/pause` - Pause current playback
- `GET /api/playback/next` - Skip to next song
- `GET /api/playback/previous` - Go to previous song

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Flask (Python web framework)
- SQLAlchemy (ORM for database operations)
- MySQL (Database)
- Spotipy (Python library for Spotify API)
- Scikit-learn (for ML-based recommendation)
- Flask-Login (for user authentication)

### Frontend
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Bootstrap (for responsive design)
- jQuery (for DOM manipulation and AJAX)
- Spotify Web Playback SDK (for music playback)

## Data Flow

1. User registers/logs in to the application
2. Application authenticates with Spotify API
3. Initial recommendations are generated based on:
   - User's Spotify listening history (if available)
   - Popular songs in user's region
   - Genre preferences (if provided during registration)
4. User interacts with recommendations:
   - Listens to songs
   - Provides feedback (like/dislike)
5. Feedback is stored in the database
6. AI recommendation engine learns from feedback
7. New recommendations are generated based on updated model
8. Process repeats, with recommendations improving over time

## AI Learning Process

1. **Initial Model**: Based on song features and popularity
2. **Feedback Collection**: User likes and dislikes are recorded
3. **Feature Extraction**: Audio features from songs are analyzed
4. **Model Update**: Recommendation algorithm is adjusted based on feedback
5. **Personalization**: Recommendations become more tailored to user preferences
6. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Balance between recommending known preferences and introducing new songs

## Security Considerations

- Password hashing for user authentication
- Secure storage of Spotify API tokens
- CSRF protection for form submissions
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- HTTPS for all communications
